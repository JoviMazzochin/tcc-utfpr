# Segmentation and counting of wood trunks using Deep Learning and Image Processing.

Counting objects in images is a pattern recognition problem that aims to identify an element and determine its incidence in the analyzed image. 
Approached in the literature as Visual Object Counting \gls{voc}, an application of this technique can be decisive, directly influencing the final 
result of a detailed analysis. In the present work we approach an experiment applied in a database of wood logs, aiming at the segmentation, 
identification and counting of the logs present in an input image. To solve the problem, our method consists of two main steps, the segmentation 
of the image and the counting of incidences of wood logs. To perform the image segmentation, the Pix2Pix framework was used, which consists of 
applying the concept known as Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks \gls{cgans} wich performs pixel-by-pixel segmentation. For counting 
incidences of the wood trunk in the image, algorithms were implemented using the following techniques: Hough Transform, Connected Components and 
Morphological Reconstruction.
